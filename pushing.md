# Pushing to GitHub

To push a repository to GitHub, we need to:

1. We need a local repository
2. We need a GitHub repository (create that on GitHub)
3. Connect the local and GitHub repository, we do that using something called a remote
4. Once we have connected the repositories, we can then use the `git push` command to push our changes upto the repository
